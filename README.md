# ESOstuff

This is a collection of useful ESO tools.

At the moment it contains:
* dfits for linux64 [https://www.eso.org/sci/software/eclipse/eug/eug/node8.html]
* dtfits for linux64 [https://www.eso.org/sci/software/eclipse/eug/eug/node9.html]
* fitsort for linux64 [https://www.eso.org/sci/software/eclipse/eug/eug/node8.html]

You will probably need to make them executable with: 
```
chmod +x <tool_name>
```
